You can first download this file. It will be used in the following exercises and will be named "Log file".

For each exercise, write a program that will be able to run in a Linux environment (Debian stable). A README file that contains all needed instructions to launch the program and an example of its output is required.

Exercise 1:
We want to find, in the Log file, all the duplicates and the line numbers where they appear.
The program will take the path to the Log file as an argument and will display (in the standard output) each duplicate and the line numbers where it appears.
An analysis of your algorithm and its complexity will have to be provided.

Exercise 2:
Same question than before, but this time, it is not the duplicates but the anagrams that have to be found.
The output will display, using lists, each anagram found and their line numbers.
